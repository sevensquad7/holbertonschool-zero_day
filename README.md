# Git

These are my first steps around git as a Holberton student.

## Commands used

```
git add <project name>
git clone /path/to/repository 
git add <temp.txt> 
git commit –m “descriptive message”
git push  origin <branch>
```

## Expectations

I trust my dedication and the motivation I have to continue advancing in the computer world.
